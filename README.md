# 💡 Google Keep on scrimba

I received challenging assignment on **Scrimba**. The task was to clone the behaviour and the functionality of __Google Keep__.

In this post I will outline the _tasks_ that I was required to do:
1. Create a HTML page with a simple input box and button. Below the  input box, I created an empty ~~division~~ div to store the input.
 
2. Next, I wrote boilerplate CSS to style the HTML.

3. In the JavaScript file I took the value of the Input and populated it in the hidden division on click.
```
let input = document.querySelector('input');
let btn = document.querySelector('.btn');
let div = document.querySelector('div');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
   // Puts the Information Inside the hidden div
})
```

JavaScript is also used extensively to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. With JavaScript, developers can add, remove, or modify elements of the DOM, allowing them to dynamically update the content of a web page without the need for a full page refresh.

Another important feature of JavaScript is its ability to communicate with servers using asynchronous requests. This allows web applications to retrieve data from a server without the need for a full page refresh, improving the overall user experience.

In conclusion, JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is essential for web development. Its ability to handle user input, manipulate the DOM, and communicate with servers has made it a popular choice among developers. With its wide range of libraries and tools, it is possible to create complex web applications that are both functional and user-friendly.

### About Me

Hi there! My name is Neil Deshmukh and I'm a 10-year-old in 5th grade who is learning frontend development. I'm really interested in creating websites and applications that look great and are easy for people to use. I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to continue building my skills in these areas.

As a frontend developer, I know that it's important to focus on the user experience and make sure that the websites and applications I create are visually appealing and easy to navigate. I'm also interested in learning more about design principles, user experience design, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

Although I know there's a lot to learn, I'm always eager to explore new ideas and try out new things. I know that making mistakes is part of the learning process, and I'm not afraid to make them as I continue to practice and improve my skills.

I'm excited to see where my frontend development journey takes me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow in this field.
